              Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol
                        draft-ssmith-ipex-latest

Abstract

   The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol provides a
   uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs
   [ACDC-ID] in a securely attributable manner.  A single protocol is
   able to work for both types of exchanges by recognizing that all
   exchanges (both issuance and presentation) may be modeled as the
   disclosure of information by a Discloser to a Disclosee.  The
   difference between exchange types is the information disclosed not
   the mechanism for disclosure.  Furthermore, the chaining mechanism of
   ACDCs and support for both targeted and untargeted ACDCs provide
   sufficient variability to accommodate the differences in applications
   or use cases without requiring a difference in the exchange protocol
   itself.  This greatly simplifies the exchange protocol.  This
   simplification has two primary advantages.  The first is enhanced
   security.  A well-delimited protocol can be designed and analyzed to
   minimize and mitigate attack mechanisms.  The second is convenience.
   A standard simple protocol is easier to implement, support, update,
   understand, and adopt.  The tooling is more consistent.

   This IPEX [IPEX-ID] protocol leverages important features of ACDCs
   and ancillary protocols such as CESR [CESR-ID], SAIDs [SAID-ID], and
   CESR-Proofs [Proof-ID] as well as Ricardian contracts [RC] and
   graduated disclosure (partial, selective, full) to enable
   contractually protected disclosure.  Contractually protected
   disclosure includes both chain-link confidential [CLC] and contingent
   disclosure [ACDC-ID].

2.  Terminology

   Presentation Exchange  An exchange that provides disclosure of one or
      more ACDCs between a _Discloser_ and a _Disclosee_.

   A presentation exchange is the process by which authenticatable
   information may be exchanged between two parties, namely, the
   _Discloser_ and _Disclosee_.

   ACDC  Type of data as issuance concretely defined by the ACDC
      specification [ACDC-ID].

   Discloser  An ACDC in a disclosure is _disclosed by_ the _Discloser_.

   Disclosee  An ACDC in a disclosure is _disclosed to_ the _Disclosee_.

   Issuer  An _ACDC_ is _issued by_ the _Issuer_. The _Issuer_
      identifier (AID) appears in the top level of the ACDC.

   Issuee  An _ACDC_ is optionally _issued to_ the _Issuee_. When
      present, the _Issuee_ identifier (AID) appears at the top level of
      the attribute section or in the attribute list at the top level of
      the attribute aggregate section of the ACDC.

   Each _ACDC_ MUST have an _Issuer_ and MAY have an _Issuee_.

   The set of _ACDCs_ so disclosed in a _presentation exchange_ MUST be
   chained.  This set of chained _ACDCs_ define a directed acyclic graph
   (DAG) that MUST have at least one vertex and MAY have zero or more
   edges pointing to other vertices.

   Each _ACDC_ itself defines a graph fragment consisting of one vertex
   and zero or more directed edges.  Each directed edge contained in an
   _ACDC_ points to a vertex contained in another _ACDC_. The ACDC that
   contains the origin vertex of the DAG is called the _origin_ or
   _primary_ ACDC of the _presentation exchange_.

   The disclosure performed by a presentation exchange MAY be
   _graduated_ and MAY be _contractually protected_.

   Issuance Exchange  A special case of a _presentation exchange_ where
      the _Discloser_ is the _Issuer_ of the _origin_ (Primary) _ACDC_
      of the DAG formed by the set of chained ACDCs so disclosed.

   In an _issuance exchange_, when the _origin_ ACDC has an _Issuee_,
   the _Disclosee_ MAY also be the _origin_ ACDC's _Issuee_.

2.1.  Chain-Link Confidentiality

   Disclosures via Presentations Exchanges may be contractually
   protected by Chain-Link Confidentiality (i.e a Chain-Link
   Confidential disclosure).  The chaining in this case is different
   from the chaining described above between Issuances in a DAG of
   chained Issuances.  Chain-link confidentiality, in contrast, chains
   together a sequence of Disclosees.  Each Disclosee in the sequence in
   turn is the Discloser to the next Disclosee.  The terms-of-use of the
   original disclosure as applied to the original Disclosee MUST be
   applied by each subsequent Discloser to each subsequent Disclosee via
   each of the subsequent disclosures (presentation exchanges).  These
   terms-of-use typically constrain disclosure to only approved parties,
   i.e. imbue the chain of disclosures with some degree of
   confidentiality.  These terms-of-use are meant to contractually
   protect the data rights of the original Issuer or Issuee of the data
   being disclosed.

3.1.  Discussion

   All the variants of an ACDC are various degrees of expansion of the
   compact variant.  Therefore, an Issuer commitment via a signature to
   any variant of ACDC (compact, full, etc) makes a cryptographic
   commitment to the top-level section fields shared by all variants of
   that ACDC because the value of a top level section field is either
   the SAD or the SAID of the SAD of the associated section.  Both a SAD
   and its SAID, when signed, each provide a verifiable commitment to
   the SAD.  In the former the signature verification is directly agains
   the SAD itself.  In the latter, the SAID as digest must first be
   verified against its SAD and then the signature on the SAID may be
   verified.  This indirect verifiablity assumes that the cryptographic
   strength of the SAID digest is equivalent to the cryptographic
   strength of the signature used to sign it.  To clarify, because all
   variants share the same top level structure as the compact variant,
   then a signature on any variant may be used to verify the Issuer's
   committment to any other variant either directly or indirectly, in
   whole or in part on a top-level section by top-level section basis.
   This cross-variant Issuer commitment verifiability is an essential
   property that supports graduated disclosure by the Disclosee of any
   or all variants wether it be full, compact, metadata, partial,
   selective, bulk issued, or contractually protected.

   To elaborate, the SAID of a given variant is useful even when it is
   not the SAID of the variant the Issuer signed because during
   graduated disclosure the Discloser MAY choose to sign that given
   variant to fullfill a given step in an IPEX graduated disclosure
   transaction.  The Discloser thereby can make a verifiable disclosure
   in a given step of the SAD of a given variant that fulfills a
   commitment made in a prior step via its signature on merely the SAID
   of the SAD of the variant so disclosed.

   For example, the Metadata variant of an ACDC will have a different
   SAID than the Compact variant because some of the top-level field
   values may be empty in the Metadata variant.  One can think of the
   The metadata variant as a partial manifest that only includes those
   top level sections that the Discloser is committing to disclose in
   order to induce the Disclosee to agree to the contractual terms of
   use when disclosed.  The IPEX transaction is between the Discloser
   and Disclosee, who both may make non-repudiable commitments via
   signing to each other.  Typically this means that the Discloser will
   eventually need to fulfull its commitment with a proof of disclosure
   to the Disclosee.  This proof may be satisfied with either directly
   against the Discloser's signature on the the actual disclosed SAD or
   indirectly agaisnt the Discloser's signature on the SAID of the
   actual disclosed SAD.  In addition, the Disclosee will typically
   require a proof of issuance via a non-repudiable signature by the
   Issuer on a variant of the disclosed SAD that is verifiable (directly
   or indirectly) against the variant that is the disclosed SAD.

   To summarize, when the Issuer commits to the composed schema of an
   ACDC it is committing to all the variants so composed.  As described
   above, the top level field values in the compact variant enable
   verification against a disclosure of any of the other Issuer
   committed variants because they all share the same top level
   structure.  This applies even to the metadata variant in spite of it
   only providing values for some top level sections and not others.
   The verifiablity of a top level section is separable.

   Consequently, the IPEX protocol must specify how a validator does
   validation of any variant in a graduated disclosure.  To restate
   there are two proofs that a Discloser must provide.  The first is
   proof of issuance and the second is proof of disclosure.  In the
   former, the Discloser provide the variant via its SAD that was
   actually signed (as SAD or SAID of SAD) by the Issuer in order for
   the Disclosee to verify authentic issuance via the signature on that
   variant.  In the latter, the Discloser must disclose any other Issuer
   enabled (via schema composition) variants that the Discloser offered
   to disclose as part of the graduated disclosure process.

3.2.  IPEX Validation

   The goal is to define a validation process (set of rules) that works
   for all variants of an ACDC and for all types of graduated disclosure
   of that ACDC.

   For example, in the bulk issuance of an ACDC, the Issuer only signs
   the blinded SAID of the SAD that is the Compact variant of the ACDC
   not the SAD itself.  This enable a Discloser to make a proof of
   inclusion of the ACDC in a bulk issuance set by unblinding the
   signature on the blinded SAID without leaking correlation to anything
   but the blinded SAID itself.  To clarify, the Disclosee can verify
   the signature on the SAID without to prove set inclusion with needing
   the disclosure of any other information about the ACDC.  Issuer
   signing of the SAID not the SAD also has the side benefit of
   minimizing the computation of large numbers of bulk issued
   signatures.

3.2.1.  Issuer Signing Rules

   The Issuer MUST provide a signature on the SAID of the most compact
   variant defined by the schema of the ACDC.  When more than one
   variant is defined by the schema via the oneOf composition operator
   for any top-level field, the most compact variant MUST appear as the
   first entry in the oneOf list.  When only one variant of each top-
   level field is defined by the schema, that variant is therefore by
   defintion the most compact variant.

   The different variants of an ACDC form a hash tree (using SAIDs) that
   is analogous to a Merkle Tree.  Signing the top-level SAID of the
   compact version of the ACDC is equivalent to signing the Merkle Root
   of a Merkle Tree.  Different variants of an ACDC (SADs with SAIDs)
   correspond to different paths through a Merkle tree.  The process of
   verifying that a SAD via its SAID of a section is included in a
   schema authorized variant down from the top-level SAID is equivalent
   to a Merkle Tree proof of inclusion along a path in the Merkel Tree
   down from its Root.  This allows a single signature to provide proof
   of Issuance of the presentation of any schema authorized variants of
   the ACDC.

   An Issuer MAY provide signatures of the SAIDS of other variants, as
   well as signatures of the SADs of other variants.

   Proof of issuance is provided by disclosing the SAID of the most
   compact variant and the signature by the Issuer on that SAID.

   Proof of disclosure is provided by disclosing the SAD of the most
   compact variant and then recursively disclosing the nested SADs of
   each of the top level sections of the most compact variant as needed
   for the promised disclosure.

   Thus for any disclosed variant of an ACDC, the Disclosee need only
   verify only one proof of issuance as defined above and may need to
   verify a different proof of disclosure for each disclosed variant as
   defined above.
